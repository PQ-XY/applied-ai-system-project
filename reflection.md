# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
    Owner — manages pets and their scheduler, stores personal contact info
    Pet — represents individual pets with species, breed, health info; records activities
    Scheduler — the algorithmic core that manages, prioritizes, and organizes all tasks
    Task — individual activities (feeding, walks, medications, appointments, etc.) with priority levels
    TaskType — enum defining the six main task categories

    Relationships:

        Owner owns multiple Pets (1:*)
        Owner has one Scheduler (1:1)
        Scheduler manages multiple Tasks (1:*)
        Tasks are assigned to specific Pets (*:1)

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

**Yes, three key design decisions changed during implementation:**

**Change 1: Added `recurrence` field to Task class**
- *Original design*: Task was static—once created and completed, it was done.
- *Implementation change*: Added `recurrence: str` field (values: `None`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`) to support repeating tasks.
- *Why*: Realistic pet care requires repeated tasks (daily feeding, weekly grooming). Without recurrence, owners would have to manually create thousands of task instances for a pet's lifetime. This field makes the system practical.

**Change 2: Conflict detection as warnings, not enforcement**
- *Original design*: Scheduler would "organize and prioritize" tasks but was vague on how to handle conflicts.
- *Implementation change*: Created `detect_conflicts()` as a separate method that returns warning messages rather than preventing task addition or auto-rescheduling.
- *Why*: We chose to let owners add conflicting tasks but alert them, rather than silently rejecting or auto-fixing schedules. This preserves owner control and transparency—important for a system managing pet health.

**Change 3: Updated Task.mark_complete() to accept Scheduler instance**
- *Original design*: `mark_complete()` was just a toggle; no mention of cascading effects.
- *Implementation change*: Modified signature to `mark_complete(self, scheduler: 'Scheduler' = None)` so that completing a recurring task automatically creates the next occurrence.
- *Why*: Without this, recurring tasks would disappear after completion and need manual re-creation. Passing the scheduler enables the Task to communicate back and trigger `create_next_occurrence()`.

**Overall rationale for changes:** The initial design was structurally sound but underspecified algorithmically. During implementation, we discovered that realistic pet scheduling needed three features not explicitly in the skeleton: recurrence handling, lightweight conflict detection, and task regeneration. These changes kept the object model clean while adding practical functionality.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?

**Constraints implemented:**
1. **Time conflict** (primary): Tasks can't occur at the same time. Detects overlaps when:
   - Same pet has multiple tasks at identical time (impossible)
   - Different pets both need attention at identical time (owner can't do both)
2. **Completion status**: Only active (incomplete) tasks are checked for conflicts; completed tasks don't block scheduling
3. **Recurrence pattern**: Daily/weekly tasks automatically regenerate after completion, respecting the recurrence frequency
4. **Pet assignment**: Each task tied to a specific pet; conflicts are pet-aware
5. **Task priority**: Stored on each task but not yet used for conflict resolution (future enhancement)

**Constraints NOT implemented (but could be):**
- Task duration (we only check exact times, not time windows)
- Travel time between pets
- Owner availability preferences
- Pet-specific preferences or behaviors
- Task dependencies/sequencing
- Resource constraints beyond owner time

- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**Decision rationale:**
1. **Time conflicts first** — This is the hardest constraint to violate; it's logically impossible. An owner physically cannot walk two pets simultaneously. This was the highest priority.
2. **Completion status** — Completed tasks should never block new scheduling. Filtering active tasks keeps the system practical.
3. **Pet assignment** — Critical for linking tasks to specific animals; enables pet-level conflict detection.
4. **Recurrence** — Essential for realistic pet care (daily feeding, medication). Without it, the owner would manually re-add tasks constantly.
5. **Priority** — Deferred. While tasks have priority levels, we haven't implemented priority-based rescheduling yet. Time conflicts take absolute precedence over priority optimization.

**Trade-off made:** We chose *correctness over convenience*. The scheduler guarantees no logically impossible schedules (no double-booking), even if it means rejecting some schedules with warnings rather than auto-fixing them. This puts responsibility on the owner to manually resolve conflicts, which is safer than the system silently rescheduling tasks.

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

**Tradeoff: Exact time matching vs. duration-aware conflict detection**

- *What we chose*: Conflict detection only checks if two tasks occur at the **exact same time**. No consideration of task duration or time windows.
  - Example: A 30-minute walk (2PM–2:30PM) and a 1-hour walk (2:15PM–3:15PM) would NOT be flagged as conflicting because neither task has a duration field.

- *What we didn't choose*: A more complex duration-aware system that would detect overlapping time windows and warn about any minute of overlap.

**Why this tradeoff is reasonable for pet scheduling:**

1. **Simplicity & Speed**: Exact time matching is O(n) with a single pass; duration awareness would require interval overlap checks (O(n²) worst case). For a pet owner with 20-30 tasks/week, the simpler approach is sufficient.

2. **Pet care task patterns**: Most pet tasks in reality have **specific times, not durations**:
   - "Feed Max at 8:00 AM" (instantaneous action)
   - "Give Luna medication at 20:00" (quick action)
   - "Walk Buddy at 15:30" (owner's concern is the start time, not a locked 30-min window)
   - The owner will naturally leave time between tasks; they don't schedule walks back-to-back at 2:00, 2:15, 2:30.

3. **Owner flexibility**: If the owner realizes two tasks are too close together (e.g., walk at 2:00, grooming at 2:15), they can easily adjust by 15 minutes. The warning system gives them visibility to make this decision.

4. **Real-world precedent**: Most pet care apps and calendar systems use time-point scheduling, not time-window enforcement, for exactly this reason.

**Future enhancement**: If the system grew to include multiple pets and caregivers with strict time windows, duration-aware conflict detection would become necessary.
